<h2>
Converting JSON to XML is essential in scenarios where data needs to flow between systems that use different formats. JSON is widely used in modern applications due to its simplicity and efficiency, while XML remains a standard in many legacy systems and industries that require structured data with schema validation. This conversion enables interoperability, allowing JSON-based systems to communicate with XML-reliant APIs or services, such as SOAP-based web services. Additionally, it supports workflows where data is stored in JSON but must be transformed into XML for reporting, configuration, or compliance with industry standards. By bridging the gap between these formats, JSON-to-XML conversion ensures seamless data exchange across diverse systems and tools.</h2>
